// 2026-10-04 per SIMPLIFICATION-CHECKPOINT C2, C3 and C6): the
// in-memory record of effects the allocator admitted that the census may not
// show yet. A pass counts an effect through its entry until the effect's
// marker (the row a create wrote, or the incarnation a start's PreWake wrote)
// is in the census that pass counts; then it clears the entry and counts the
// row instead. So no pass counts an effect twice or not at all (I-ledger),
// and clearing needs only the effect's own row, never a store-wide watermark.
// The ledger is planning bookkeeping, not a correctness source: any read may
// be stale, clearing errs toward fewer starts, and every effect re-checks at
// its own boundary (C0.6).
//
// One writer per move: only the allocator reserves, releases and clears; a
// session key issues a reserved grant or leaves it alone, then commits or
// fails what it issued; the create executor does the same for creates.
// Nothing is persisted (C5.14): after a restart the rows' durable markers
// stand in for lost entries.
//
// Unwired in this slice: P3-5b reserves, releases and clears from its pure
// decide over View, P3-6 runs creates, and P4.1's session keys issue grants.
