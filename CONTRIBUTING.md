# Contributing to Gas City

Gas City is experimental software, but the repo is now structured for external
contributors. Before making changes, read:

- [docs/index.mdx](docs/index.mdx)
- [engdocs/contributors/index.md](engdocs/contributors/index.md)
- [engdocs/contributors/codebase-map.md](engdocs/contributors/codebase-map.md)
- [engdocs/architecture/index.md](engdocs/architecture/index.md)
- [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what is planned and how to propose work

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Install prerequisites from
   [docs/getting-started/installation.md](docs/getting-started/installation.md).
4. Set up tooling and hooks: `make setup`
5. Build and run the fast quality gates: `make build && make check`
6. Optional: if you use Bazel, opt in to the project's anonymous, read-only
   build cache by adding `build --config=fork-cache` to your gitignored
   `.bazelrc.local` (or pass `--config=fork-cache` per command). Results CI
   already computed become cache hits; nothing you build is uploaded. See
   [engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md](engdocs/bazel-quickstart.md).

`make setup` installs a pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that
auto-formats staged Go files and, when any Go file is staged,
regenerates `internal/api/openapi.json` and `docs/reference/schema/openapi.json`
from the live supervisor. The hook stages both spec copies so the
committed spec never drifts from what the server actually serves. It also
runs the fast CI-equivalent gates for local changes: `make lint`,
`make vet`, and `make test` for Go changes, and `make check-docs` for
Markdown/docs/spec changes.

**Dashboard SPA.** The dashboard at `internal/api/dashboardspa/web/` is a
TypeScript SPA that talks directly to the supervisor's OpenAPI-typed
endpoints. When `internal/api/openapi.json` changes, the hook regenerates
`internal/api/dashboardspa/web/shared/src/generated/gc-supervisor-client/`
(the typed API client) and, when that or the SPA source changes, rebuilds
`internal/api/dashboardspa/dist/` (the compiled bundle that the Go static
server embeds via `go:embed`). The hook needs Node / npm on your PATH; if
npm is missing and a spec change is staged, the hook now fails closed with
the recovery command, since a stale client would otherwise ship silently
until CI catches it — for unrelated (docs/Go-only) changes it still just
warns and skips the rebuild. The hook runs dashboard typecheck, Vitest, and
production build for dashboard/API-schema changes. Run `make dashboard-dev`
to iterate with Vite HMR, `make dashboard-build` to produce a fresh
bundle, `make dashboard-check` for typecheck + build + test. For
API-schema changes, run `make dashboard-ci` instead — it also regenerates
the typed client from the spec and fails if that or `dist/` is stale,
which `dashboard-check` alone does not catch. For dashboard or API-schema
changes, also smoke the built app with
`npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>` from
`internal/api/dashboardspa/web/` and load the served page before pushing.

## Development Workflow

Every pull request links a documented issue, maintainers included. GitHub
Issues is the public tracker, and the issue is where the context lives: why
the change is needed, what it affects, and how we will know it works. The
issue does not need maintainer approval before you open the pull request;
file it first or alongside.

1. Find or file an issue. Use the issue forms: they ask for the motivation,
   impact, risk, and verification plan (or, for a bug, the reproduction and
   impact), which is most of what review needs. Changes that add SDK surface
   should explain how they pass the
   [Primitive Test](engdocs/contributors/primitive-test.md).
2. Create a branch from `main` (see [Branch Naming](#branch-naming)) and make
   the change.
3. Run `make check`, and `make check-docs` if you touched docs, navigation,
   or cross-links.
4. Open a pull request whose description says `Closes #<issue>` and shows
   evidence that the change works end to end.

Using an AI agent is fine; you are accountable for what it produces. Agents
working in this repo read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which carries the same
rules.

What is planned next is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Git hook ownership

**`.githooks` is the single owner of `core.hooksPath`.** Install it with
`make setup`; verify it with `make check-hooks`.

Only one directory can own `core.hooksPath`, and beads' installer claims it
for `.beads/hooks`. Those hooks exec `bd hooks run <hook>` without chaining
onward, so while beads owns the path every gate in `.githooks` — staged-Go
formatting, `lint-changed`, the three codegen+stage steps, `make vet`, and the
push-time suite — is skipped on every commit. Nothing reports this: git simply
stops invoking the hooks, so commits look clean while spec-derived drift lands
on the mainline until a later suite failure surfaces the drift.

Reclaiming the path does not disable beads. Each `.githooks` hook forwards to
`.githooks/lib/beads-chain.sh`, which runs `bd hooks run <hook>` with the same
timeout and exit-code carve-outs beads' own integration block used. Adding a
hook that beads manages means adding its `.githooks` counterpart too —
`TestGitHooksCoverEveryBeadsManagedHook` in `scripts/` fails otherwise.

Beads' installer can reclaim `core.hooksPath` at any time. When it does,
`make check-hooks` fails and `make setup` puts it back.

`make spec-ci` (run by the required `preflight-generated` CI job) is the
backstop for spec/client drift, but it only sees work that reaches a PR —
locally merged branches depend on the pre-commit gate actually running.

### Branch Naming

Never open a PR from your fork's `main` branch. Use a dedicated branch per PR:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/session-startup upstream/main
git checkout -b docs/mintlify-nav upstream/main
```

Suggested prefixes:

- `fix/*`
- `feat/*`
- `refactor/*`
- `docs/*`

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions.
- Keep functions focused and small.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Add comments only when the logic is not self-evident.

## Design Philosophy

Gas City follows two project-level principles that should shape changes:

### Zero Framework Cognition

Go handles transport, not reasoning. If the behavior belongs in the model or
prompt, do not encode it as framework intelligence in Go.

### Bitter Lesson Alignment

Prefer durable infrastructure, observability, and composition over brittle
heuristics that a stronger model should eventually handle better.

For the capability boundary, use the
[Primitive Test](engdocs/contributors/primitive-test.md).

## Docs Workflow

The docs tree is now Mintlify-based.

- Config lives in `docs/docs.json`
- Preview locally with `cd docs && ./mint.sh dev`
- Run docs checks with `make check-docs`

When updating docs:

- Architecture docs describe current behavior
- Design docs describe proposed behavior
- Archive docs keep historical notes out of the main onboarding path
- Updating `GastownCity()`'s `Imports` or `DefaultRigImports` map requires
  updating the auto-import table in `engdocs/design/packv2/migration.mdx`

### Docs link conventions

`docs/` is published to **[docs.gascityhall.com](https://docs.gascityhall.com)**
via Mintlify — it is **not** meant to be read directly on GitHub. The published
site serves **route-based, extensionless URLs**, so internal page links must be
written that way:

| Context | Correct | Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/` page link (Mintlify) | `/tutorials/01-beads` | `/tutorials/01-beads.md` |
| `engdocs/` and root `.md` (GitHub-only) | `engdocs/architecture/index.md` | `engdocs/architecture/index` |

**Why this matters — and why you usually do _not_ want to "fix" a docs path:**
a `.md`/`.mdx` suffix on a `docs/` page link breaks Mintlify navigation on the
live site **even though the file exists on disk**. A link that looks "broken" on
GitHub is very often correct for the deployed site, so reformatting `docs/` links
to be GitHub-friendly is the most common way to *silently break the published
docs*.

Two checks enforce this, both failing **only on net-new** breakage your change
introduces (pre-existing issues won't block you):

- `make check-docs` (`test/docsync`) — on-disk check that `docs/` page links are
  extensionless and that `engdocs/`/root links resolve.
- The **Docs render check** CI Action (`.github/workflows/docs-render.yml`) —
  runs Mintlify's own `broken-links` against your branch vs `main`.

If a `docs/` link is **genuinely** broken on the live site, note it in your PR
and a maintainer will fix it Mintlify-side — don't change the on-disk path to
work around GitHub rendering.

## Make Targets

Run `make help` for the full list. The most useful targets are:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install local tools and git hooks |
| `make build` | Build `gc` with version metadata |
| `make install` | Install `gc` into `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` |
| `make check` | Fast Go quality gates |
| `make check-docs` | Docs sync tests (on-disk link checker; does not run `mint broken-links`) |
| `make check-all` | Extended quality gates including integration tests |
| `make test` | Unit and repo-level Go tests |
| `make test-integration` | Integration tests |
| `make test-integration-huma` | Supervisor binary smoke test (builds `gc`, boots the supervisor, asserts `/openapi.json` + `gc cities` work) |
| `make dashboard-build` | Compile the dashboard bundle and sync it into the embedded `dist/` |
| `make dashboard-dev` | Vite dev server for SPA iteration |
| `make dashboard-check` | Typecheck + build + test the dashboard |
| `make dashboard-ci` | `dashboard-check` plus fail-on-drift for the generated API client and `dist/` — the gate for openapi.json/dashboard changes |
| `make cover` | Coverage run |

> **`make install` writes to the shared `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.** It (and
> `go install ./cmd/gc`) install `gc` there, and `make install` also re-points
> an existing `~/.local/bin/gc` at the result — so when that path is the binary
> a running deployment uses (commonly `~/.local/bin/gc` → `~/go/bin/gc`),
> installing from any checkout silently replaces the live `gc`, and every later
> `gc` exec runs the just-installed build. To redirect when that isn't
> intended, run `make install INSTALL_DIR=<dir>` (the `install` target writes
> `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` and ignores `GOBIN`), or for a plain
> `go install ./cmd/gc` set `GOBIN=<dir>`. `make build` (→ `./bin/gc`) is
> unaffected.

## macOS Local Development

On macOS, `make build` signs `gc` with a stable local codesigning identity
when one is available. Stable signing helps macOS TCC remember local
permission grants, such as App Management and Apple Events, across rebuilds.

The build auto-detects the first valid certificate in your keychain, in this
order: `Apple Development:`, `Developer ID Application:`, then `GasCity Dev`.
Override the selection with `GC_SIGN_IDENTITY=<certificate name>`.
The signing identifier defaults to `com.gascity.gc`; override it with
`GC_SIGN_IDENTIFIER=<identifier>` only when you intentionally want a separate
local TCC identity. After a successful stable or opt-in ad-hoc signing pass,
the script removes the `com.apple.provenance` extended attribute when present
so macOS does not retain stale local-build provenance metadata.

If no stable identity is available, the build leaves Go's linker-produced
macOS signature unchanged. It does not automatically ad-hoc re-sign the
binary, because ad-hoc signing creates a fresh identity and can cause repeated
TCC prompts. If you need the old behavior for a local experiment, opt in with
`GC_ADHOC_SIGN=1`.

Getting a free local certificate does not require paid Apple Developer Program
membership:

- **Apple Development**: Xcode -> Settings -> Accounts -> sign in with an
  Apple ID -> Manage Certificates -> `+` -> Apple Development.
- **Self-signed**: Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Create a
  Certificate. Use Identity Type **Self Signed Root** and Certificate Type
  **Code Signing**. Name it `GasCity Dev` for auto-detection, or set
  `GC_SIGN_IDENTITY` to its name.

For official distribution, local development signing is not enough; release
artifacts need a Developer ID certificate and notarization.

## macOS Release Verification

Before tagging a release, run the macOS smoke test on a Mac:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-macos.sh                     # latest release, arm64
GC_VERSION=v0.13.4 ./scripts/smoke-macos.sh  # specific version
GC_ARCH=amd64 ./scripts/smoke-macos.sh       # Intel binary
```

The script downloads the release archive, extracts the `gc` binary, and runs it
inside a `sandbox-exec` jail that denies network access and restricts filesystem
writes to a temp directory. Tests: `version`, `help`, `doctor`, `init`.

Run this after changing build/packaging scripts or upgrading the Go toolchain.

## Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `type(scope): summary`, e.g. `fix(session): keep work beads on close`
- Use present tense
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Explain *why* in the body; reviewers and `git blame` readers see the commit,
  not the PR thread
- Reference the issue (`Closes #123`) in the pull request description

## Issue Triage Labels

Every new issue gets `status/needs-triage`. Maintainers then move it along
this ladder:

| Label | Meaning | Who applies it |
|---|---|---|
| `status/needs-triage` | Inbox — not looked at yet | Automation, on open |
| `status/needs-info` | Waiting on the reporter for details | Maintainers / automation |
| `status/needs-repro` | Cannot be investigated without a reproduction | Maintainers / automation |
| `status/needs-design` | Real need, but the approach must be agreed before code | Maintainers |
| `status/accepted` | Confirmed and on our radar | Maintainers only |
| `status/help-wanted` | Accepted and explicitly open to outside contributors | Maintainers only |

`kind/*` says what the issue is (bug, feature, docs, chore, ...) and
`priority/p0`–`priority/p3` says how urgent it is.

When you file an issue, automation may apply labels that indicate missing
information. Here is what to expect.

### `status/needs-repro`

Applied when the issue cannot be investigated without a minimal reproduction.
Automation will leave a request comment explaining what is needed. Please reply
within 14 days — the 14-day window starts from that comment, not from when
the label was applied.

### `status/needs-info`

Applied when additional details are required. Automation will leave a request
comment explaining what information is needed. Please reply within 14 days of
that comment.

### What happens next

- **You reply or open a PR that addresses the question**: automation removes
  the label and the stale-close path is canceled. You can always respond even
  after the 14 days have passed.
- **14 days pass with no response**: the issue is closed as "not planned"
  with a comment that references the original request. Replying to the closed
  issue reopens the conversation; include the requested details so triage can
  continue.

Both labels are removed automatically when the original reporter comments on
the issue or pushes a synchronizing commit to a linked pull request.

## Pull Request Pipeline Labels

Maintainers run an automated review-and-merge pipeline. These labels are
applied by maintainers and by that automation; contributors should not add or
remove them.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status/needs-review` | Review requested |
| `status/needs-review-auto` | Review requested with auto approval |
| `status/reviewing` | Automated review is running |
| `status/review-failed` | Review workflow failed before merge-ready |
| `status/merge-ready` | Review passed; ready for the merge queue |
| `status/merge-queued` | Queued for the deterministic merge |
| `status/merge-failed` | Merge queue needs operator attention |
| `status/human-review-required` | Opt-out from auto-merge; waits for a co-maintainer |
| `needs-architectural-review` | Permanent hold pending architectural review; blocks auto-merge |
| `status/needs-bugflow` | Bugflow investigation requested on an issue |
| `needs-mac`, `needs-review-formulas` | Run optional CI lanes on this PR |
