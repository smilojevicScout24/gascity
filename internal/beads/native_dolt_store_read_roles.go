// The role-accessor front doors for the three issue reads: the detail view, the
// listing and the ready frontier.
//
// The reason is the one the graph and delete front doors already carry, and it
// is sharper here. SearchIssues over the v0 wire serves exactly TWO shapes —
// exact-ids and the parent walk — and refuses every other filter, so every gc
// listing except Children was a hard failure on a served city. GetReadyWork is
// served only as a bridge, and it refuses any WorkFilter.Status other than open
// by name (encode's E-WorkFilter.Status), which is precisely what the old
// two-status Ready loop sent on its second pass: Ready failed outright.
// issueops.Reader is a required member of the Storage contract, so routing
// through it is the ONE path every backend answers.
//
// WHAT MOVED WITH THE DOOR, stated once because all three reads share it: the
// role is a HIGH-LEVEL request, not a filter. It applies bd's own list policy
// — the closed and pinned status exclusions, the template, gate and infra-type
// suppressions, the ephemeral-plane decision, and a DEFAULT PAGE SIZE — inside,
// where the raw filter this replaced applied none of it. Every one of those is
// a NARROWING, and adopting a narrowing under a re-point would silently drop
// rows gc lists today. So the request below lifts all of them and gc's own
// ListQuery projection (ApplyListQuery) does the exact filtering it already
// did. What that costs is recorded on nativeListLimitPushdown.

// nativeListReadRequest is the shape every gc listing sends.
//
// AllFlag is doing two jobs, and the second is the one that decides the
// spelling. It drops the default STATUS exclusions (closed, pinned, and any
// workspace status in the done or frozen category), and it lifts the
// PINNED-FLAG default: workapi.BuildListFilter stamps Pinned=&false for every
// request that neither sets AllFlag nor names a pinned-selecting status, so a
// named status — even "closed", even the exact status gc asked for — would drop
// a pinned-flagged row that the raw search returned.
//
// Status:"all" IS AN EQUIVALENT SPELLING of that lift, not a second option and
// not a road not taken: BuildListFilter reads it through the same
// splitStatusSelector, and a lone "all" both skips the exclusion default (its
// len(statusParts)==0 arm) and satisfies statusSelectsPinned, so the two
// requests resolve to the same filter, and both cross the wire (`all` and
// `status` are each published). The only other lifts of the pinned half are
// "pinned" and "hooked", and neither lifts the status exclusions, so neither
// is a substitute. AllFlag is stated because it says what it does in the member
// name rather than in a magic status value.
//
// There is no ExcludeStatus member to spell "everything but closed"
// with, so the status axis cannot be pushed down at all; gc's three-value
// projection (mapBdStatus, ListQuery.Matches) is the only definition of it and
// it runs Go-side, where it always did.
//
// The four include flags lift the type and plane suppressions in the same
// spirit. They are stated individually rather than as IncludeAllTypes because
// that member is refused on the wire (E-ListRequest.IncludeAllTypes) and this
// request has to cross it. IncludeInfra alone would already open the ephemeral
// plane — it is strictly wider than IncludeEphemeral, admitting both the infra
// TYPES and the wisps TABLE — but IncludeEphemeral is stated beside it because
// the two are separate promises: one keeps message/agent/role rows, the other
// keeps the plane, and a future change to either upstream must not silently
// take the other with it.

// THE DETAIL VIEW IS THE ONE TOKEN SOURCE. issueops.IssueDetails.Revision is

// read RowVersion off a served row would hand every guarded write a fabricated
// 0 — which, being a real value that matches an un-mutated legacy row, is the
// one wrong answer a CAS cannot detect. A LIST row publishes no token at all,
// and Bead.Revision is left at zero there deliberately: absent is absent, never
// 0, and a caller that means to act on a row it listed re-reads it here first.

// had already expired — is not askable here. It is also not NEEDED, and that is
// a measured fact rather than an assumption: every backend runs the lazy
// defer-wake sweep in its own write transaction immediately before the ready
// read (issueops.WakeExpiredDefersInTx, called from
// internal/storage/{dolt,embeddeddolt}/queries.go and the unit-of-work reader),
// and that sweep flips exactly the rows the second pass was looking for —
// status='deferred' AND defer_until <= now — to open. They arrive in the FIRST
// answer, already woken. What stays hidden is what stayed hidden before: an
// indefinite deferral, which carries no defer_until and which the sweep
// therefore never touches.
//
// THE ONE RESIDUE is a READ-ONLY store, where the sweep declines to run (it is
// a write) and an expired deferral keeps its status. gc no longer resurfaces it
// there. Neither does `bd ready` against the same store, which is the point:
// this door answers what bd answers, and the old second pass was gc diverging
// from it.
//
// IncludeDeferred stays OFF. It looks like the natural spelling for "let the

// close should not satisfy a blocking dependency (ga-a7v0ex).
//
// This is a NARROW override on top of an already-authoritative verdict, not a
// from-scratch recompute of blocking status — see BdStore.filterReadyByWorkOutcome
// for the full rationale, which applies identically here. Deliberately NOT
// DependencySatisfied: a candidate is here because the ready read already
// cleared its gating, which is richer than "the target is closed" (a pinned
// blocker satisfies a blocks edge, and a waits-for edge gates on the spawner's
// children rather than the spawner's own status). Only the closed-and-blocked
// case — invisible to the store's own check — may override that verdict.
//
// It runs INSIDE Ready's withReadRetry closure on the caller's ctx/storage, so
// it must not call anything that re-enters withReadRetry.
//
// The read is two role requests whatever the frontier size: a chunked
// EdgeReader read of every candidate's own edges (nativeReadEdgesChunkSize,
// merged across chunks — the server rejects a ReadEdges call outright once its
// anchor count exceeds its own cap, rather than serving the first N and
// reporting the rest missing), and a blocker-outcome read that tries
// IssueReader.List(IDFilter) FIRST and falls back to a fan-out of
// IssueReader.Get calls — one per DISTINCT ready-blocking target id, bounded
// at nativeReadyEdgeFanoutLimit concurrency — only when that List refuses.
//
// List first, not Get-only, because a native (dolt or Postgres) IssueReader
// answers List+IDFilter in one SQL statement regardless of the blocker count,
// and an unconditional per-id Get fan-out against THAT backend was its own
// regression (S5b-fixrev item 1): six-ish round trips per blocker every
// controller tick, the same #6491 pattern the fan-out exists to avoid for an
// http-native backend. Only an http-native IssueReader refuses this shape —
// bd-enterprise's httpstore encode table, E-ListRequest.IDFilter: "an explicit
// id set on the LISTING refuses ... the exact-ids question is getIssue's,
// reached through the SearchIssues bridge's exact-ids shape, not through a
// listing filter" — and it refuses CLIENT-SIDE, before any round trip, with a
// *httpstore.InexpressibleError that unwraps to a typed *beadslib.ErrUnsupported
// (errors.As reaches it through the chain). Get is the wire's door for that
// exact-ids question instead, and it is a per-id door, so fan-out is the
// fallback's only route to it (S5b-portrev item 1 / S5b-fixrev item 1;
// re-ports 1aab10d3d0's ReadEdges chunking and fea3240cd5's probe-then-fallback
// shape, which still applies here even though this call site never had the
// capability-probed batched arm those commits guarded — the probe is now
// List+IDFilter itself, answered or refused in the same call, rather than a
// separate capability check). A per-candidate Get is one round trip each on a
// served store, which over a network link exhausted the read-retry budget
// every controller tick (#6491) — now paid only by the backend that actually
// requires it. A target the read does not return — an external reference,
// another ledger's row — is no evidence of blocking, on either leg.
//
// The result does not depend on edge or fetch order: every fetched target's
// metadata is parsed exactly once up front, and a malformed one is reported
// against the first candidate (in candidate order) that references it,
// choosing the lowest target id when that candidate references more than one.
// A real (non-ErrNotFound) blocker fetch failure fails the whole filter —
// never silently passing the candidate it would have vetoed — and cancels any
// still-queued fan-out calls rather than paying for every remaining blocker
// fetch before reporting an error it already had.

//
//   - STATUS, because the request has no ExcludeStatus and no way to name
//     "every status but closed", and because any named status re-arms the
//     pinned-flag default. See nativeListReadRequest.
//   - TYPE, because BuildListFilter VALIDATES it against the workspace
//     vocabulary and fails a request naming an unknown one, where the raw
//     filter answered empty — and because naming an INFRA type (agent, role,
//     message) routes the query to the ephemeral plane ALONE, which would hide
//     every durable mail bead. gc's type predicate is exact in ApplyListQuery.
//   - TIER, because the plane knobs only ADMIT. There is no member that
//     excludes the ephemeral rows a TierIssues read must drop, so that filter
//     is ApplyListQuery's, as the wisp-tier filter already was.

// typed or not-closed listing now fetches the whole candidate set and cuts the
