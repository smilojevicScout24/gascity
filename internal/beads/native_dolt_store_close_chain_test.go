// CloseAll's PER-BEAD route, which is what a backing with no batch applier
// takes. The route CloseAll takes when one is available is one request per
// chunk and is pinned next door, in native_dolt_store_batch_close_test.go;
// closeChainStorage below refuses the applier so this file keeps measuring the
// loop rather than silently becoming a second test of the batch.
//
// The metadata-then-close pair is gc's one write chain that needs a value an
// earlier write in the same chain produced: gc stamps close_reason into the
// metadata, and the close carries that reason.
//
// It used to recover the reason with a follow-up read — Close's own GetIssue,
// dialed on top of the status read the loop already makes. The lifecycle role
// answers every write with its post-state snapshot (issueops.UpdateResult.Issue,
// the member that also carries the post-write RowVersion a guarded chain
// composes its next ExpectedVersion from), so the reason comes off the result.
//
// The doubles below make both halves observable: rawReads counts the raw
// read-backs the chain dials, and the lifecycle records every request. A
// re-introduced follow-up Get shows up as a raw read; a reason taken from the
// pre-write row shows up as the stale value.

// on the structure instead: one storage acquisition resolves one accessor, so a
// SECOND accessor resolution is the re-entry, deterministically and with no
// timing. The path exists precisely for the misbehaving backend, and hanging is
