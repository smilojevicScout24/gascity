// and the drain that announces each queued close once. That is once per cache,
// not once per close: a close another process made and announced itself
// reaches this cache either as its bead.closed, absorbed as already announced,
// or through a read, and when the read lands first this cache announces the
// close as well, so the bus carries two bead.closed for it.

// trackCloseTransitionLocked keeps unannouncedCloses in step with the row just
// installed for id. A row that is not closed cancels any queued close (a
// reopen before the drain must not announce a stale close). A not-closed to
// closed transition is queued unless the caller announces it itself, and so is
// a closed row installed with no cached row before it while a closing write of
// ours is in flight (closeIntents). Caller must hold c.mu in write mode.
